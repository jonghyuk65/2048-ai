Just for my term project...

Browser game control part is wholly from https://github.com/nneonneo/2048-ai

Should install [Remote Control for Firefox](https://github.com/nneonneo/FF-Remote-Control/raw/V_1.2/remote_control-1.2-fx.xpi)

Not going to implement current state of the art methods (tree search with heuristic evaluation: https://github.com/nneonneo/2048-ai, temporal difference learning: https://github.com/aszczepanski/2048)

Final goal is to make mixture of mcts and q network learing (or value network learning) like AlphaGo

Currently implemented: random, maximum merge(greedy), monte carlo simulation

TODO: monte carlo tree search, deep q learning
