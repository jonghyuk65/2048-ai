Q function should be symmetric -> make only Q_left and get others by transposing
szubert 2014 failed to use Q learning -> because non-symmetric Q function?

maximum = 2^17
goal -> achieve 2^16
8 straight lines + 9 squares -> extract minimum (0, 2^1 ~ 2^15), possible form (position of minimum 4 * 16^3)
->  17 values to fully connected network to features(how many?) to relu then regression -> reward backprop
